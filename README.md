# Workout-Tracker

    
## Description
    
This application allows a user to keep track of their daily workouts. On your home screen, your last workout's information will be displayed (if you've added a workout before). To add a workout, a you click "New Workout", then enters their workout's information. A workout is able to have multiple exercises, so after entering the first exercise's info, click "Add Exercise" and you'll be redirected to the "Add Your Exercise" screen where you can add the next exercise. Once you've entered your full workout, click "Complete". Your Dashboard will give you the duration and weight statistics of all of your past week's workouts.

This application uses MongoDB to store the data entered by the user. Express, mongoose, and morgan are also dependencies of this app. Heroku is used for deployment (see [Usage](#usage) tab for link).
